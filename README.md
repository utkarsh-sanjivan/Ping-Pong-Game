## About the Game
This is a classic Ping Pong game in which you have to score the game points first before the CPU. The game has two paddles that can be controlled by the `Up` and `Down` button on the keyboard and for mobile and tablets there are seperate buttons provided to do the same. This game has sound that is generated whenever a shot is played or whenever a point is scored. The sound can be muted/unmuted for which a button is provided seperately but in PCs and Laptops this can also be done using the `M` key. The game can also be paused/unpaused with the button provided ot using `P`, `Esc`, `Enter` and `Spacebar` key. The game has a dropdown for adjusting the points to win the game which can be set to `15`, `21`, `31` and `51`. The can eb restarted too using the button provided or by `R` key.
